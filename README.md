# old personal website 

This repo holds the code for old version of my person website. 

I preserved it at `http://ahsanazim-old-website.surge.sh/`.

I chose to still keep the code around and have it be deployed too because the old website had more technical bells and whistles than the current one does. Helpful to look at when needing a reference for things like navbars changing color with scroll position, and the like.
